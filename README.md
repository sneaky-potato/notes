# Vantage Point

> As a full time computer nerd I would like to write something something

Repository for project codenamed `second brain` or `notes`.

## Getting started

The idea for this project roots Obsidian and its potential use in building a second brain.
I was particularly fascinated by the graph view it provides and the ease of connecting different notes for making what anyone would call a literal hoarding of data.
I plan to pen down majority of the information I come across on a day-to-day basis on computers and related things.

### Tools

Since the publish feature of Obsidian is paid, my next natural move was to use an open source implmentation of the same thing. That is when I found about [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) which is a convinient tool to publish
notes written as if they were written in a vault f obsidian. It interanlly uses some static site generator written in typescript

### Dive

The whole thing is deployed [here](https://sneaky-potato.github.io/notes) and can be traversed easily using the backticks. I will try to make it more easy for someone to get themselves immersed in the information I provide.
