This a digital hoarding of all my learnings. Let's see where this goes eventually.

Some starting points to navigate in this labyrinth:
- [[dotfiles]] for ricing nerds, _warning_: I am a tiling window manager user
- [[vim]] the only editor I will approve of, always
- [[ctf]] a form of competition I take some interest in, sometimes
- [[hardware-security]] perfect crossover of security and systems
- [[web-dev]]
- [[compilers]] a rather deep dive in compilation, execution, binaries
- [[os]] for system madlads
- [[cpp]] still learning this humongoes language to get better at computer systems
- [[reading]]
