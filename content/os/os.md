# Operating Systems

At the time of writing this note, I am running a machine with the following specifications:
- Operating System: Arch Linux
- Kernel: Linux 6.12.45-1-lts
- Architecture: x86-64

And that is why much of the notes found here will be related to linux environment.

- Recently I tried writing a minimal [[container]] program in golang
- How [[lazy-binding-shared-library|lazy binding in shared library]] works to save time in operating systems
