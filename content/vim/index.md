title: vim

A tool which I have been using for more than a year now. I have found some shenanigans which I find cool (and use sometimes to feel like a hecker).

- Something on the [[command-mode]] of vim
- Use more of [[buffers]]
- Simple, yet very powerful, [[norm]] command
- [[g|G]] command is for goats
